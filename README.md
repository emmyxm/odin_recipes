# HTML Foundations

## Introduction
This repository documents my progress through the HTML Foundations course.  
It contains lessons, notes, and projects that demonstrate my understanding of the basics of web development.  

## What I Learned

1. *Introduction to HTML and CSS*  
   - Learned that HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language, not programming code.  
   - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling HTML elements.  

2. *Elements and Tags*  
   - How to properly write elements and tags.  
   - Difference between normal tags and self-closing tags.  

3. *HTML Boilerplate*  
   - Learned the structure of a boilerplate including <!DOCTYPE html>, <meta charset="UTF-8">, <head>, and <body>.  

4. *Working with Text*  
   - How to structure text with paragraphs, bold, italic, line breaks (<br>), and horizontal rules (<hr>).  

5. *Lists*  
   - Ordered lists (<ol>) and unordered lists (<ul>).  
   - List items (<li>).  

6. *Links and Images*  
   - Difference between absolute and relative links.  
   - How to use the href attribute.  
   - Adding images with <img src="" alt=""> and why alt is important.  

7. *Commit Messages*  
   - Best practices for writing commit messages in the active/imperative style (e.g., “Fix bug” instead of “Bug fixed”).  

8. *Project: Recipes* (coming next)  
   - A practical project where I will apply all the skills learned above.  

## Reflection
By completing this section, I have built a solid foundation in HTML and CSS.  
I now understand how to structure content, add links and images, style text, and maintain clean commit practices.  
This project also prepares me to work on real-world tasks like building and documenting web pages.
